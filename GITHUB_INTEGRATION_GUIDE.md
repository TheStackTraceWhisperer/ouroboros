# GitHub Integration Service Configuration

## Overview
The GitHub Integration Service provides centralized observability and control for agent tasks by synchronizing goal proposals with GitHub Issues and organizing large features with GitHub Projects. This allows human oversight through a familiar GitHub interface.

## Features

### GitHub Issues Integration
- **Automatic Issue Creation**: New goal proposals are automatically converted to GitHub Issues
- **Status Synchronization**: Proposal status changes are reflected as issue comments
- **Issue Closure**: Completed or failed proposals automatically close their corresponding issues
- **Label Management**: Issues can be tagged with relevant labels for categorization

### GitHub Projects Integration (New)
- **Feature Project Creation**: Large features can be organized into GitHub Projects
- **Issue-to-Project Linking**: Issues can be added to projects for better organization
- **Project Item Status Tracking**: Status updates for project items
- **Project-based Workflow**: Support for feature design and tracking workflows

## Configuration

### Required Properties
Add these properties to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
# GitHub Integration Configuration
github.integration.enabled=true
github.integration.token=${OUROBOROS_GITHUB_PAT:}
github.integration.repository.owner=${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER:TheStackTraceWhisperer}
github.integration.repository.name=${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME:ouroboros}
github.integration.sync.interval=60000
```

### GitHub Personal Access Token Setup
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with these permissions:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `public_repo` (Access to public repositories)
   - `project` (Full control of projects) - **New for Projects support**
3. Copy the token and set it as the `OUROBOROS_GITHUB_PAT` environment variable or GitHub Actions secret

### Repository Configuration
- `github.integration.repository.owner`: Your GitHub username or organization name (uses `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` env var or defaults to `TheStackTraceWhisperer`)
- `github.integration.repository.name`: The repository name where issues will be created (uses `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME` env var or defaults to `ouroboros`)
- `github.integration.sync.interval`: Sync interval in milliseconds (default: 60000 = 1 minute)

### GitHub Actions Integration
When running in GitHub Actions, the integration will automatically use the `OUROBOROS_GITHUB_PAT` secret if available. To configure this:

1. Go to your repository Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
2. Add a new repository secret named `OUROBOROS_GITHUB_PAT`
3. Set the value to your GitHub Personal Access Token
4. The application will automatically use this token when running in GitHub Actions

## How It Works

### 1. Goal Proposal Creation â†’ GitHub Issue
- When a new goal proposal is created with status `PENDING`
- The service creates a GitHub Issue with:
  - Title: "ðŸ¤– Agent Task: [proposal description]"
  - Body: Detailed information about the proposal
  - Status: Open

### 2. Status Changes â†’ Issue Comments
- When proposal status changes to `IN_PROGRESS`
- The service adds a comment: "ðŸ¤– Status Update: Task moved to IN_PROGRESS"

### 3. Task Completion â†’ Issue Closure
- When proposal status changes to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`
- The service:
  - Adds a final summary comment
  - Adds a label (`status:completed` or `status:failed`)
  - Closes the GitHub Issue

## API Endpoints

### Create Goal Proposal
```bash
POST /api/goal-proposals
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "Implement feature X to improve user experience",
  "createdBy": "development-agent"
}
```

### Get All Proposals
```bash
GET /api/goal-proposals
```

### Get Proposal by ID
```bash
GET /api/goal-proposals/{id}
```

### Update Proposal Status
```bash
PUT /api/goal-proposals/{id}/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
}
```

### Get Proposals by Status
```bash
GET /api/goal-proposals/status/PENDING
GET /api/goal-proposals/status/IN_PROGRESS
GET /api/goal-proposals/status/COMPLETED
GET /api/goal-proposals/status/FAILED
```

### GitHub Projects API Endpoints

#### Create Feature Project
```bash
POST /api/github/projects
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "featureName": "User Authentication System",
  "description": "Implement OAuth2-based authentication with social login support"
}
```

#### Add Issue to Project
```bash
POST /api/github/projects/{projectId}/issues/{issueId}
```

#### Update Project Item Status
```bash
PUT /api/github/projects/{projectId}/items/{itemId}/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "In Progress"
}
```

## Example Workflow

### Basic Issue Tracking Workflow

1. **Agent creates proposal:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/goal-proposals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Fix critical bug in payment system", "createdBy": "self-enhancing-agent"}'
```

2. **GitHub Issue is created automatically** (within 1 minute)

3. **Agent updates status:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/goal-proposals/{id}/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "IN_PROGRESS"}'
```

4. **Comment is added to GitHub Issue** (within 1 minute)

5. **Agent completes task:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/goal-proposals/{id}/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "COMPLETED"}'
```

6. **GitHub Issue is closed with summary** (within 1 minute)

## Database Schema

The `goal_proposals` table is automatically created with:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `description`: Task description (max 1000 chars)
- `status`: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
- `github_issue_id`: Link to GitHub Issue number
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp
- `created_by`: Agent or system that created the proposal

## Monitoring

Check application logs for:
- `GitHubIntegrationService`: Sync activity and errors
- `GitHubApiClientImpl`: GitHub API interactions
- Warnings when GitHub API is not available or misconfigured

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub API Not Available
- Verify token is correct and has required permissions
- Check repository owner/name configuration
- Ensure repository exists and token has access

### Sync Not Working
- Check `github.integration.enabled=true`
- Verify sync interval configuration
- Look for error logs in GitHubIntegrationService

### Rate Limiting
- GitHub API has rate limits (5000 requests/hour for authenticated users)
- The service respects these limits automatically
- Consider increasing sync interval if needed
